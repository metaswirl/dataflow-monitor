- Adapt folder structure to ansibles structure
  - Can roles be used?
  - Can variables be defined in the inventory?
- Store actual start time of flink job
- Wrap python dependencies in a virtualenv (only 'requests' library?)
- Check if Flink/Mera are running, if so close
  - only before first execution
- Enable local execution
  - needs to change a number of variables...
  - is it really worth it?
